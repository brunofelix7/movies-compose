# Google Play Console Release Notes Generator

When the user asks to generate release notes, follow these steps:

1. **Analyze Recent Changes**: Use \git log\ or review the recent git history to determine what features, fixes, and improvements were added in the latest release or since the last tag.
2. **Format for Play Console**:
    - The release notes must be written in **English**.
    - Keep it concise, engaging, and easy to read for users.
    - Maximum length: 500 characters.
    - Use bullet points.
    - Group similar items if necessary (e.g., UI improvements, Bug fixes).
3. **Output**: Present the generated release notes clearly in a markdown block so the user can easily copy and paste them into the Google Play Console.
